# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

## Search for flow effects in H1 ep collisions
### Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Zhenyu Chen 
Jan. 2020 - Present

*  The ATLAS results show an obvious flow signal in high multiplicity pp collisions, which indicates that the small system can be explained by the hydrodynamic frame. The Hera ZEUS has shown their results of no collectivity in ep collision with DIS(deep inelastic scattering) selections, and the search for collectivity in ep collisions diverts into the quasi-real region, where the photoproduction process dominates.

*  We use two-particle correlation method to describe the possibility distributions of ∆η, ∆φ of all tracks, and don’t find any obvious signals of collectivity within H1 DIS and photoproduction data. To remove the non-flow effects, the peripheral subtraction and template fit methods are all employed. Firstly in MC models(DJANGOH and RAPGAP) the template fit method shows better removal capacity, so we apply it into the photoproduction data.


*  The results show that in high multiplicity region, gathered by the resolved photoproduction process which is similar to pp collisions, the Fourier harmonics Vn,n can be consistent with 0.

*  During the research, I finish and adjust the two-particle correlation method, and do the non-flow removal procedure in both DIS, photoproduction, and MC data to help get the conclusion. As the research uses track information in the hadronic centre-of-mass frame, the fluctuating collision energy induces difference detector acceptance, and I do modifications in non-flow removal procedure to eliminate the differences. I also write the analysis notes for this research.


## Decorrelation effect in PbPb collisions with AMPT model
### Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Li Yi
Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2019

*  AMPT model is a multi-phase transport model to comprehensively describe the dynamics in heavy-ion collisions, of which the initial condition is based on the HIJING model. The decorrelation effect is a breakdown of correlation of particles both in flow magnitude and orientation, where this correlation was thought to keep Lorentz-boost at early times especially in the longitudinal direction. The event-by-event fluctuations in the initial state are thought as the main source of the decorrelation effect, as the different eccentricity in two-side going direction leading to a different flow.

*  The AMPT model gives us a simulation of the early parton dynamics and final hadronic matter, and transitions between them, and we also see how the other collision systems behave in this model. As the data possessing is quite time-consuming, we focus our attention on the results in fixed centrality. In PbPb collisions with fixed impact parameter 8 fm, the results based on q-vector method show that in AMPT model simulations, not only the initial-state geometry contributes to the decorrelation effect, but also the transport processes contribute significantly.

*  During this research, I run the AMPT model data with a fixed impact parameter to save time and get 110,000 events after 4 months. I also use q-vector method to construct the observable to describe the decorrelation effect. Due to the difficulty of modifying the model, we can only get a meaningful conclusion from the comparison between the initial and final state rather than every state in the AMPT model.
